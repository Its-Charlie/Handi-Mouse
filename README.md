# Handi-Mouse

**Handi-Mouse** is a Python-based hand-gesture driven mouse/controller interface.  
Use your hand (via webcam) to control the cursor — no physical mouse needed.

## 🧠 What It Does

- Tracks your hand in real time using computer-vision.  
- Converts hand movement and gestures into mouse-like control (cursor movement / clicks / actions).  
- Enables “hands-free” control — useful for accessibility, touchless control, or gesture-based interfaces.
